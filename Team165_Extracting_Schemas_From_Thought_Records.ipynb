    "# <i>Natural language processing for cognitive behavioral therapy: extracting schemas from thought records</i>\n",
    "\n",
    ">This script accompanies the journal article with the title stated above. The main aim of the research is to determine whether an algorithm can label utterances expressed in thought records with regard to the schema(s) they reflect. Thought record forms are a tool in cognitive therapy with which patients should gain insight into their maladaptive thought processes. According to the theory underlying cognitive therapy, it is these malaptive thought processes that result in the respective mental illness.  \n",

    "The purpose of this script is to test Hypothesis 1, i.e. to see whether an algorithm can attach the correct schema label to thought record utterances more often than would be expected by chance. A thought record utterance could reflect none, any one, or multiple of 9 possible schemas. Additionally, labels are not binary (does or does not reflect schema) but ordinal (0 - has nothing to do with schema, 1 - has a little bit to do with the schema, 2 - has to do with the schema, 3 - fits perfectly with the schema). <br>\n",
    "Utterances are in natural language format. It is therefore necessary to preprocess these pieces of text, which we do in R. We also split the entire raw dataset into training, validation and test sets. The test set is created by taking 15% of the raw data, the validation set is created by taking another 15% of the remaining data. <br>\n",
    "Three algorithms are explored: k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks. We arrived at the former two, by following the decision tree presented by scikitLearn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/). The data are ordinal, labeled, and we have less than 100k samples. The recurrent neural networks are a logical choice for natural language data, since they allow modelling the temporal aspect that is inherent to sentences as sequences of words.<br>\n",
    "The wall time of runtimes are provided in the first comment of cells of time intensive code. Additionally, the cell magic \"%%time\" in these cells ensures that runtimes are printed so that these can be compared to the reported runtimes to get appropriate estimates when running on a different machine.<br>\n",

We only try all three types of standard kernels and do not do any additional parameter tuning. Just like the kNN, the support vector machine takes as input the utterances encoded as averages of word vectors. Support vector classification and regression do not allow for multilabel output. We therefore train disjoint models, one for each schema.<br>\n",

To ensure that we cannot be accused of reporting just a \"lucky shot\", we have decided to follow the advice given in this blog post https://machinelearningmastery.com/reproducible-results-neural-networks-keras/ . We therefore train 30 multi-label neural nets with the best parameters identfied with the Talos scan. We report the mean Spearman correlations in the article. We do the same with the per-schema RNNs below."

This way, the labels are treated as separate classes. We take over the parameter values from the multilabel model for the number of LSTM units, the dropout rate, the loss function, the evaluation metric, the batch size, and the number of epochs. To obtain the probability for each class, the units of the output layer have a softmax activation function. For the evaluation, the class with the highest probability is chosen per model. The resulting models are written to files and loaded again for prediction."
